distort - a small visualizer for a fm synth <br />
    this creates a one oscillator fm synth and visualisation to match <br />
    the visualisation is created using sin and cos function applied to the a for loop of lines being drawn <br />
    this is then distorted by a x and y factor, or randomised synced to the clock <br />
    moving the mouse in the x direction creates creates a higher base tone for the osc <br />
    moving the mouse in the y direction increases the mod lfo speed <br />
    if the mouse is moved at speed it changes the frequency of the note triggers <br /> <br />
